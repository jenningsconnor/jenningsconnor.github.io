# Springboard Capstone Project - PUBG

> Project Overview

Player Unknown's Battleground has been credited as popularizing the battle royale game mode. Though its concurrent player count of about 100k is a far cry from its all-time high of 3 million, PUBG's role as a blueprint for other battle royale games - most notably the wildly successful Fortnite. Given the game's popularity and impact - and the rising popularity of e-sports as a whole - perhaps the most important question to ask is whether a player's win/loss ratio can be predicted based on their performance. This project aims to answer that question.

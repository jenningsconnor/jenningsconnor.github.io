# Connor Jennings Data Analytics Portfolio

> Introduction

In my journey through the world of data analysis, I've worked on projects utilizing programs like SQL and Python. I've created this portfolio as a means for anyone to analyze or replicate my work. 

> My interest and experience in Data Analytics

At my core I am a story teller, and there are few stories I love telling more than those of data. I've always been fascinated by the world of statistical analysis. I graduated from Penn State University in May 2015 with a Bacherlor's in Criminology, a field heavily reliant on data analysis. Though I've held various administrative and creative positions, none were able to scratch the analytic itch I've had.

# Connor Jennings Data Analytics Portfolio

> Introduction

This site serves as a portfolio of my various data analysis projects. For each project I'll list the key findings and will provide links to datasets used and coding repositories. At no point will I post a project if I do not have authorization to do so. 

> My interest and experience in Data Analytics

At my core I am a story teller, and there are few stories I love telling more than those of data. I've always been fascinated by the world of statistical analysis. I graduated from Penn State University in May 2015 with a Bacherlor's in Criminology, a field heavily reliant on data analysis. Though I've held various administrative and creative positions post-college, none of them felt like a fit. Eventually, I decided to dive deep into the analytics world in order to transition into an analaytics-based career.
